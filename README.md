# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Project  

## Overview  
This project was developed as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes various implementations of tree operations, graph algorithms, sorting techniques, and utility functions. The project is structured around essential concepts such as AVL trees, Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm, Fenwick trees, and basic sorting methods.  

## Features  
- **AVL Tree Operations:**  
  - Insertion, deletion, rotation, balance checking, and in-order traversal.  
  - Search and update operations for stored data.  

- **Graph Algorithms:**  
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path based on distance, cost, or time.  
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths between all pairs of locations.  
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used for traversing graphs and searching paths.  

- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.  

- **Data Handling & Storage:**  
  - Loading and saving data from files.  
  - Logging actions such as additions and deletions.  

- **Additional Utilities:**  
  - Fenwick Tree for range sum queries.  
  - Matrix manipulations for adjacency representations.  
  - Pathfinding and array operations.  

## Usage  
- The program provides options to manage tree data, perform graph operations, and apply sorting techniques.  
- Modify `systemFunctions.h` and `systemFunctions.c` to experiment with different data structures and algorithms.  

## Learning Outcomes  
- Understanding AVL trees and self-balancing techniques.  
- Implementing and optimizing shortest path algorithms.  
- Sorting and searching methodologies in practical applications.  
- File handling for data persistence.
